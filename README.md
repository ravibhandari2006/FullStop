Detecting stopping behaviour of buses

This is part of an ongoing research in detecting stopping behaviour of buses. Presently, the codes correspond to detecting the following scenarios:
1. Has the bus completely stopped at the bus stop? (vs a rolling stop)
2. Has the bus stopped exactly at the bus stop? (vs stopping a few meters after/before the stop)
3. Has the bus stopped in the right lane?

We provide an android application where the smartphone has to be mounted on the dashboard of the bus. Since the size is >25MB, it is not allowing to upload it here. Please find the link as under:

Do not clone the repository yet. We are currently in the process of updating and documenting the repository. It will take some time as there are multiple scripts. We have not included the dataset here because of space constraints. Also, sharing video data has significant privacy issues. Please email at ravibhandari2006@gmail.com if you require the dataset or for any other requests.
