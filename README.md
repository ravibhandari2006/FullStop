Detecting stopping behaviour of buses

This is part of an ongoing research in detecting stopping behaviour of buses. Presently, the codes correspond to detecting the following scenarios:
1. Has the bus completely stopped at the bus stop? (vs a rolling stop)
2. Has the bus stopped exactly at the bus stop? (vs stopping a few meters after/before the stop)
3. Has the bus stopped in the right lane?

We provide an android application where the smartphone has to be mounted on the dashboard of the bus.
